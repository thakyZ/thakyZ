Hello, I am Nick, I have an ATA degree in IT with lots of years of experience with Linux Server Administration. I have been renting a dedicated server for about 7 years now. For a while I have been using it to host games with friends and manage security and software on the server all on my own. Most of the money comes out of my pocket and I do have a Patreon. If you would like to donate to help me, every bit counts.

I have been programming since I was 7 and initially started with Torque. Granted, I wasn't all that good with Torque, but I ended up going into C# and C++ from that point on. Sadly, I didn't know about Git at the time, so I never ended up posted everything I programmed to here and instead lost it, at the time, on a four-year-old hard drive that died.

I have since been uploading mods I have made for games, and other things such as projects I have been working on. I also have a GitLab account.

I work very hard to keep my server running, and to make sure it's in all working order, sometimes people don't notify me in time on my Discord server, but I do end up finding out something is broken via Cron Jobs I have set up to notify if anything broke.

If you would like to fork any of my repos you are welcome to, they are all under the MIT license and if you give me credit as per the license, I'll be fine with it.
