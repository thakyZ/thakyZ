Hello I am Nick, I am currently in school for Information Technology. I am hoping to major in Linux Server Administration. I have been renting a dedicated server for about 5 years now. For a while I have been using it to host games with friends and manage security and software on the server all on my own. Most of the money comes out of my pocket and I do have a Patreon if you would like to donate to help me, every bit counts.

I have been programming since I was 7 and initially started with Torque, granted I wasn't all that good with torque, but I ended up going into C# and C++ from that point on. Sadly I didn't know about Git at the time, so I never ended up posted everything I programmed to here and instead lost it, at the time, on a four-year-old hard drive that died.

I have since been uploading mods I have made for games, and other things such as projects I have been working on. I also have a personal GitLab base and a normal GitLab account.

I work very hard to keep my server running, and to make sure it's in all working order, sometimes people don't notify me in time on my Discord server, but I do end up finding out something is broken via Cron Jobs I have set up to notify if anything broke.

I have been in college for about 2 years now because of prerequisites and I have less than 2 years left.

Furthermore, I am part of the LGBTQIA+ community, and I am neurodivergent.

If you would like to fork any of my repos you are welcome to, they are all under the MIT license and as long as you give me credit I will be fine with it.
